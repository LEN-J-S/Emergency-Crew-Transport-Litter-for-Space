## Inspiration

Being part of Robotics-UH and the different CAD challenges we have done in the past, this challenge was a benchmark for involving all engineering majors to brainstorm ideas for this challenge. The CAD assignment was the most exciting part the team was excited to have taken part in bringing different ideas while building the mechanism in CAD.

### What it does

The litter will be used for moving an incapacitated astronauts from their particular location to safety. The whole Litter will be 50lbs and 25lbs will be distributed with each astronauts to be carried at every location. The Litter will also be motor and self propelled. The Litter is also capable of moving for 14 Km at 4Km/hr.

**How we built it**

We built the Litter first drawing it on paper and then analyzing all the criteria's are met, we proceeded to work the design on SolidWorks to get the sketch of the final prototype.

**Challenges we ran into**

The main challenges we ran into is weight limit criteria of 50lbs for the overall system and locking the astronauts in a rigid position on the Litter. Another challenge we ran into was the design process as we had to go through 7 different design iterations.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We are proud that we have learned the different ideas brainstormed for the different iterations of design. We were also proud that different engineering teams brainstormed in each integral part of the design process. We are also proud that the we were able to manage tasks diligently and efficiently.

**What we learned**

We learned how to solve different engineering challenges involved in designing the Litter. The different challenges allowed us to through different variations of the challenge to make the design better and meet the criteria of 50 lbs.

**What's next for Lunar Incapacitated Crew Rescue Litter**

The next objective of the Litter is to be tested using different simulations in virtual environments and then to be tested in real-life environments. After the successful launches of these, they can be used in an emergency situation when an astronauts life is in danger.
